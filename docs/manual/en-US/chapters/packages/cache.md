## The Cache Package

### Drivers

A number of cache drivers are provided in the cache package. Custom drivers can be included by simply extending the `JCache` class.

#### APC

#### File

#### Memcached

#### None

#### Wincache

#### XCache

### Revision History

This package was completely refactored in version 13.1 of the platform. The old version of `JCache` is available in the legacy tree under `/legacy/cache`. Note that the old and the new version of the cache package are incompatible so they cannot be used together.
